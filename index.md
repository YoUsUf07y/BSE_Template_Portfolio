# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to complete the H-bridge and make the motors spin. An H-bridge is a circuit that allows you to control a DC motor to make it go backward or forward. To make the motors spin, I had to complete the H-Bridge. To do this I connect the motors to the arduino and the battery pack through the H-bridge, which is how they are able to move. The arduino addresses each motor and both its pins using the locations where the jumper wires were plugged in on the arduino, and it tells one pin to go high and the other to go low for the motors to spin one direction, and then uses the opposite set up for the motors to spin the opposite direction.  When I plug the code into the arduino, the motors spin going clockwise and counter-clockwise.
